This theme focuses on the content, not the metadata. It is designed to be used with the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note-taking app, but it can be used with any markdown files.

For more convienient post creation, we use `_notes` collection instead of `_posts`. This way, the file name does not have to be `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`. Instead, you can name it whatever you want, and the date will be automatically added to the frontmatter.
